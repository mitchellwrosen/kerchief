A command-line "spaced repetition software" flashcard app, simliar to Anki, but without a GUI (and, you know, shittier).

Features:
- English vocab cards can be added lightning-quick (just select one of many definitions - no need to type it out yourself)
- Play mp3s to hear pronunciation (phonetic pronunciation is displayed, too)
- Uses slightly modified [SuperMemo 2 algorithm](http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm)

Contributions are welcome!
