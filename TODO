- publish/download
- better persistence
- handle: deck file bad format
- remove deck
- rename deck
- bugs when no internet connection. for example, playing and mp3 will result
   in downloading and caching an error message. actually downloading the mp3
   then requires the user to manually rm the cached file
- add card -> no -> exit (shouldnt prompt save)
